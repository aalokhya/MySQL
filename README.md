# 🐬 MySQL Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my MySQL learning repository!  
This repo serves as my personal notebook to track and reinforce my understanding of SQL concepts—from basic database operations to advanced queries and joins.

## 📘 What You'll Find Here

I've organized the repository in a structured format that aligns with my learning journey:

### 1. 🧱 SQL Basics
- Creating databases and tables  
- Inserting, deleting, truncating, and dropping data  
- Selecting data using `SELECT`, filtering with `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`

### 2. 🔁 Intermediate SQL
- Using the `WITH` clause (CTEs)  
- Pattern matching with `LIKE` and wildcards  
- Modifying tables: `UPDATE`, `ALTER TABLE`  
- Conditional filtering using `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `CASE`, `EXISTS`

### 3. 📊 Aggregations & Grouping
- Removing duplicates with `DISTINCT`  
- Aggregation functions: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`  
- Grouping and ordering results: `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`  
- Working with `ALL`, `ANY`, `TOP` (or `LIMIT`)

### 4. 🔗 Joins & Set Operations
- Joins: `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL`, `SELF`, `CROSS`  
- Joining multiple tables  
- Set operations: `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `MINUS`

### 5. 🛠️ Advanced SQL Concepts
- Views: creating and using `CREATE VIEW`  
- Constraints: `PRIMARY KEY`, `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `FOREIGN KEY`  
- Transactions: `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`  
- String, math, and date functions  
- Type conversions, conditional logic, `CASE`  
- Ranking and top-N queries using `OVER`, `RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`

## 📌 Goals

- Strengthen SQL fundamentals and writing clean queries  
- Understand relational database concepts practically  
- Build a solid foundation for backend development and data analysis  
- Prepare for technical interviews and real-world SQL tasks

## 🚧 In Progress

This is a **continuously evolving repository** and will be updated frequently as I learn new MySQL topics and apply them with practice examples.
